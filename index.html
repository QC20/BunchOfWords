        <div class="text">software developer with over 9 years of experience, I have developed a strong foundation in crafting innovative and efficient technology solutions. My passion for technology and entrepreneurship led me to co-found Mythrill, where I currently serve as the CTO. I am proud to be recognized as one of the "30under30" Armenians in Tech and am constantly driven to push boundaries and make a positive impact in the industry. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring my creative side through art, music, and nature</div>
