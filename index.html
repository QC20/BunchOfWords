        <div class="text">Everyone has hopes and asperations for the future. So do I. I have dreams. Things I want to achieve in this life. While I am certainly not there yet, and at times can feel discouraged and even stuck. I choose not to give up. I decide to keep going as there is really no other way for me to go. So should you. While I shouldn't tell you what to do and what to think, I believe in you and your abilities.</div>
